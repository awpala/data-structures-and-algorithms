# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

This repository is a collection of canonical data structures and algorithms based on the corresponding pseudocode described in "Introduction to Algorithms" (third edition, 2009) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (CLRS).

The objective of this repository is to gain insight into these fundamental concepts, and to implement them with modern programming languages using language-specific features and idioms.

**Filename convention**: Prefixed by CLRS 3ed page reference (e.g., `p156_...` for page 156).

## Dependencies and Usage

**JavaScript**: Requires Node.js v12 or higher. Run shell command `node javascript` in root directory for console outputs (cf. `javascript/index.js` for output script code).
